# hello-world
This is my introduction to using GitHub started 4.11.19
I consider myself a novice coder, although I do have a few html/css sites under my belt that were done before "responsive" was a thing. Since I am a hobbyist coder, and not usually coding, I always am starting at the beginning. Fun!
